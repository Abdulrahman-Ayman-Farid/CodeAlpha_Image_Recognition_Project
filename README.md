# Cats and Dogs Classification using VGG16

This project demonstrates how to build a Cats and Dogs image classifier using transfer learning with the VGG16 model.

## Overview

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It is trained on the Cats and Dogs dataset provided by Google. The VGG16 model, pretrained on ImageNet, is used as the base model, and its top layers are extended and trained for this specific classification task.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- TensorFlow 2.x
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
